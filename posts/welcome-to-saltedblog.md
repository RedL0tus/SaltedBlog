First, huge thanks to you for you to have interest in this project. This post is located in `posts` directory. Go ahead and edit it and refresh the page to see your changes. SaltedBlog doesn't require any generation process if you are using `js` mode which is the default mode right now. If you had already deployed SaltedBlog to your server with a Service Worker, you may have to clear your browser's cache storage to see your modification take effects.

To add posts, place your post wherever you want, and edit the posts meta you have chosen before (in this demo, it's `meta.json`). You have to specify the post `id`, `title`, `type`, `file (location)`, and `date` for the current theme to work correctly (Right now `id` and `file (location)` are necessary for any theme). Take a look at the source for this post to get an idea about how it works.

SaltedBlog can support various post formats by placing suitable plugins to the same location as the core js file (which is `js` in this demo). The `type` you've written in your posts meta decided which file SaltedBlog is going to load. This post currently using Markdown plugin powered by [showdown](http://showdownjs.com/), huge thanks to its maintainers and CloudFlare's [cdnjs.com](https://cdnjs.com).
